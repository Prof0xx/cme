**Project Title:**
Crypto Marketing Services Explorer + Lead Collector

---

**Objective:**
Create a stylish, responsive web application that lets users explore categorized crypto marketing services, select those they are interested in, and submit their Telegram handle to express interest. No purchases will occur on-site.

---

**Target Users:**
- Crypto project owners
- Web3 marketing teams
- Token launch specialists
- Startup founders

**Core Features & Functional Flow:**

### 1. **Homepage & Navigation**
- Display clickable buttons/cards for each **main service category**:
  - Listings
  - Trendings
  - PR
  - DEX Boosts
  - Botting
  - Startup
- Once a category is clicked, reveal services under it.
- Each service should only display `Service Name` and `Price`. No extra info or description is needed.

### 2. **Service Selection (Strategy Board)**
- Clicking a service adds it to a persistent selection panel (the **"Strategy Board"**, not a shopping cart).
- Allow users to remove items from the board.
- Show a **live total cost** update as services are added/removed.

### 3. **Prebuilt Packages**
- Dedicated section for:
  - Budget-Friendly Package
  - Baller Package
- Each package auto-populates the Strategy Board.
- Automatically applies a **15% discount** to package total.
- Let users remove or swap out items from packages.
